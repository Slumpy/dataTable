#Buttons

If you turn on this feature you'll get an extra column at the end of every row that contains an edit and delete button.

They both get a data-id property containing the row's primary key value. Next to that they get a special class assigned prefixed by btn-action-(edit|remove). Making it easy to add an event handler on the dataTable that delegates a click event to any button it finds with this class.
